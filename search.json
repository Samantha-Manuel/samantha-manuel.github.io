    "text": "My name is Samantha Manuel, and I am a second year PhD student in the Criminology program here at UT Dallas. I hope to help close the gap in research regarding the effects of child maltreatment on juvenile delinquency and adult criminality, and most importantly, help find potential methods to mitigate and prevent these outcomes. I recently presented my thesis, \"'I'm Still Here, I'm Still Alive': Resilience Among Survivors of Child Maltreatment\". I presented my thesis at the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences 59th Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, on March 19th, 2022. This thesis illustrated how child abuse affects one's ability to resist criminality and deviance in later adulthood. This study intended to provide a better understanding on an individual level as to why victims of childhood maltreatment choose to promote resilience and quality of life instead of criminal or antisocial behavior. By continuing with a PhD, I hope to further increase the criminological field's understanding of why some individuals do not become criminal, and go against what is expected of them.\nMy academic interests tend to focus on juvenile delinquency and related topics. My personal belief is that the youth of society are the future, and it is imperative that scholars and policy makers alike emphasize the support and scaffolding of young community members. Once I earn my PhD, I hope to become a professor. In this position, I can help teach others the importance of research and policy development. Through my continued education here at UT Dallas, I hope to gain the skills and tools I need to become a better teacher and role model for my students. I aim to inspire the youth of these communities to dream big and to become productive members of society. In addition to teaching, professors are also expected to lead research studies. I hope to use my position to help further criminological research by applying theory to policy. In this way, I will be able to best use my position to advocate for programs and initiatives that can help improve our communities.\nIn future research, I would like to continue to investigate the causes and effects of juvenile delinquency, specifically in relation to childhood maltreatment. Furthermore, I intend to expand the recently developed concept of resiliency, which is of particular interest to me. It is inspiring to me that individuals who researchers have predicted to be deviant and criminal defy what is expected of them, and ultimately become dynamic and impactful members within their community. I also hope to close the research gap on child maltreatment, resiliency, and mental health related to minority populations, especially Asian Americans. As a future researcher, I would like to empirically assess potential policies that may positively influence these populations of individuals, and help them reduce recidivism in the long run. By obtaining my PhD degree here at UT Dallas, I will better equip myself with a vast background knowledge in my field, while also fine-tuning my teaching abilities. In this way, I hope to have as much positive influence as possible on scholars to come."

Juvenile and Family Court Journal 72(3): 37-65.\nThe figure, Figure 3, is titled “Graph of Interaction Effect between Sex and Borderline Traits Predicting Status Offenses”. Interaction effects plots are used to visualize how the effect of one variable varies according to the value of another variable. According to McGill and Stefurak (2021), the female participants “exhibited higher rates of borderline traits, trauma symptoms and status offenses, as hypothesized, the sex by offending interaction suggests that these symptoms are unique predictors of male’s status offending, rather than for females”. This can be seen by the positive slope of the red line for male offenders in relation to borderline traits (Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, a pattern of intense and unstable relationships, distorted and unstable self-image, including feelings of dissociation, e.g. feeling cut off from oneself, feeling outside of one’s body, impulsive and often dangerous behaviors, recurring thoughts of suicidal behaviors or threats of suicide or self-harming behaviors, e.g. cutting, highly unstable and changeable mood states, chronic feelings of emptiness, anger management difficulties, interpersonal distrust) and status offenses (McGill and Stefurak 2021). In contrast, negative slope of the green line for female offenders in relation to borderline traits and status offenses indicates these symptoms are not unique predictors of female’s status offending. Although the chart does clearly and evidently show the opposite effects sex has on the relationship between borderline traits and status offending, there are some important components of this chart that are missing. For instance, the chart does not have labels on any component of the figure. For this reason, there is no reference for the interpreter to understand what the measurements are for the x and y axes. Furthermore, there is no indication as to the significance of the x and y axes units or increments. The chart also has no figure description attached to it within the article, so the reader does not have anything to refer to while interpreting the chart. For this reason, it is difficult for the reader to understand the importance or pertinence of the figure alone or independently without referring to the discussion and conclusion of the article."
